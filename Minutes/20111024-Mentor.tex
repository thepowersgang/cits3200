> Continual Improvement

What went well
- Rohit
 > Well defined requirements, met the requirements and client liked it.
 > Shared/distributed tasks
 > Delivered on time and within the buget
- Alwyn
 > Working closely with customer helped.
- Brian
 > Early/fast prototyping. Demo to client at each meeting
 > Helped keep the spec accurate.
- Antriksh
 > Rohit ran a tight ship
 > Plenty of reminders
- John
 > Brian's work

Improvements
- John
 > Git was maybe not the best choice, had some teething problems
- Antriksh
 > Partial lack of coordination
 > (Brian) API devs were only ones who knew what things does, testing team left in dust.
 > (Alwyn) Less segmentation, all devs with testing of other parts.
- Brian
 > Communication mostly, keeping everyone up to speed on the API
- Group meetings could be better structured
- Maybe use an IRC channel and scheduled deveop time
