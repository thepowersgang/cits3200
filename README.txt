Project Overview
The project is all about creating an Application Programming Interface (which is termed a Genetic Engine) 
for implementing Genetic Algorithms. This Engine, will have access to all of the interface classes that represent 
the populator, evaluator, terminator, genetic operator, outputter and the generation factory. This engine also 
includes classes that read from and write to XML files. The project also has files which creates the visual 
interpretation of the main functions as well as the test classes which test all of the functions in this Engine.
More about this later. 

Project Source Directory Layout
All of the Code is going to be in the GeneticEnginePrototype Folder. There is another folder which is the examplexml
folder which stores all of the XML files that are used for loading by the Interface programs in the code directory.
